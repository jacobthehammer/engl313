    <h1><em>Sonnet CXLVII</em></h1>

    <main>
<p>My love is as a fever longing still,<br>
For that which longer nurseth the disease;<br>
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,<br>
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.</p>

<p>My reason, the physician to my love,<br>
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,<br>
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve<br>
Desire is death, which physic did except.</p>

<p>Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,<br>
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;<br>
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,<br>
At random from the truth vainly expressed;</p>

<h2>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,<br>
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.<h2>
